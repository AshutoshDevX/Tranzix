# Tranzix - Banking Application

**Tranzix** is a modern banking application that allows users to sign up, sign in, and send money from their account to other account holders. It is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), with JWT-based authentication for secure access.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up and sign-in process using JWT tokens.
- **Account Management**: Users can create and manage their bank accounts.
- **Money Transfer**: Send money from your account to another account holder within the platform.
- **Responsive Interface**: Built with React and styled to be mobile-friendly.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js (Vite for development speed)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **State Management**: React Context API or Redux (depending on implementation)
  
## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tranzix.git
cd tranzix
2. Install dependencies
Frontend:

bash
Copy
cd client
npm install
Backend:

bash
Copy
cd server
npm install
3. Set up environment variables
Create a .env file in the server directory and add the following variables:

ini
Copy
MONGO_URI=your-mongo-db-uri
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
PORT=5000
4. Run the application
To start the application in development mode:

Start the backend server:

bash
Copy
cd server
npm run dev
Start the frontend development server:

bash
Copy
cd client
npm run dev
Now, your application should be running at http://localhost:3000 (for frontend) and the backend API should be running on http://localhost:5000.

Features & Usage
Sign Up: Users can create a new account by providing necessary details (name, email, password).

Sign In: Existing users can log in with their email and password.

Money Transfer: Users can transfer money to another account by providing the recipient's account number and the amount to send.

Authentication
The app uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to authenticate users. After a successful sign-in, users receive a token that they must include in the Authorization header of their requests.

Example of using the token:

bash
Copy
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
